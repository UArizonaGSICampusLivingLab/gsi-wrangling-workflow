## First time publishing

Publishing this workflow to Posit Connect will fail the first time because the environment variable `BOX_TOKEN_TEXT` is unset.  But, you still can find the app on viz.datascience.arizona.edu and add that env var.  Then, re-publish, and it should work.

## Box authorization

```{r}
box_auth_service(token_text = Sys.getenv("BOX_TOKEN_TEXT"))
dir_id <- "233031886906"
box_setwd(dir_id)
```
